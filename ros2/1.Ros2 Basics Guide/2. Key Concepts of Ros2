## Key ROS 2 Concepts

### Nodes
Nodes are individual units of executable code in ROS 2. They perform specific tasks, communicate with other nodes, and can publish or subscribe to topics.

### Topics
Topics facilitate communication between nodes. They are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. Nodes can publish data to topics or subscribe to receive messages from topics.

### Services
Services enable nodes to provide and request specific functionalities from other nodes. They follow a request-response pattern, where one node sends a request and another node provides a response.

### Actions
Actions provide a more advanced form of communication compared to services. They support more complex behaviors that require feedback and cancellation mechanisms.

### Parameters
Parameters in ROS 2 allow nodes to store and share configuration data. They provide a way to change node behavior at runtime without modifying the code.

### Launch System
The ROS 2 launch system manages the execution of multiple nodes and configuration of their parameters, namespaces, and remapping.

### Message Types
ROS 2 message types define the structure of data exchanged between nodes. They can be simple types like integers or strings, or complex structures like custom messages for specific purposes.

### ROS 2 Bags
ROS 2 bags are a vital tool for recording and playing back ROS 2 topics. They can store data from topics and save it in a file, enabling offline analysis, debugging, and replaying of recorded data.

#### Working with ROS 2 Bags:
- **Recording**: Use the `ros2 bag record` command to record data from specific topics during a ROS 2 session.
- **Playing**: Utilize `ros2 bag play` to replay previously recorded data from a bag file into ROS 2 topics.
- **Analyzing**: Bags enable offline analysis and debugging by providing access to previously recorded messages.
- **Data Management**: Bags are portable and can be shared across different environments or with others working on the project.
