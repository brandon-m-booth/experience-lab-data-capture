# ROS 2 Workspace

ROS 2 workspaces provide a structured environment for developing and managing ROS 2 projects. This section outlines the workspace structure, organization, and steps to create/manage a ROS 2 workspace within the `experience-lab-data-F23` repository.

## Workspace Structure

In ROS 2, workspaces follow a standard structure that contains packages, libraries, and configurations necessary for ROS 2 development. The primary workspace directory typically includes:

- **`src` Directory**: This directory contains the source code of ROS 2 packages. All your ROS 2 packages should reside here.
- **`build` Directory**: This directory stores the build artifacts, including compiled binaries and libraries, created during the build process.
- **`install` Directory**: Upon successful building, this directory stores the installed files and libraries of your ROS 2 workspace.
- **`log` Directory**: Log files generated by ROS 2 during execution are stored here.

## Creating and Managing a Workspace

### Initializing a ROS 2 Workspace

If you're starting a new ROS 2 project within the `experience-lab-data-F23` repository, follow these steps to create and initialize a workspace:

1. **Clone the Workspace**:
   Clone the existing ROS 2 workspace provided in the GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:gunnerysurgeon/experience-lab-data-F23.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Workspace**:
   Change directory to the ROS 2 workspace folder:

   ```bash
   cd experience-lab-data-F23/ros2
   ```

3. **Create Source Folder**:
   Within the ROS 2 workspace, the `src` directory holds your ROS 2 packages. Navigate to this directory:

   ```bash
   cd src
   ```

### Working with the Workspace

Once inside the `src` directory, you can:
- **Create ROS 2 Packages**:
  Develop your ROS 2 packages by creating new packages or adding existing ones within this folder.

- **Build the Workspace**:
  After adding/modifying packages, build the workspace using `colcon`:

  ```bash
  colcon build
  ```

- **Source the Workspace**:
  Once built, source the workspace to access its environment:

  ```bash
  . install/setup.bash
  ```

## Conclusion

Understanding the ROS 2 workspace structure and how to create/manage it is essential for ROS 2 development within the `experience-lab-data-F23` repository. Remember to organize your packages within the `src` directory and utilize tools like `colcon` for building and sourcing the workspace.
