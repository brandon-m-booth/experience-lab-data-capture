Needed tasks:
-Modernize the platform using latest libs
-Test data collection mode.  Do timestamps of sensor data packets align?
-Test annotation mode.  Do annotations align with collected data?
-Improve usability


My questions:
-What are the program's current shortcomings in usability?
-What part of the software stack are we working on?
-Any updates on what sensors we will have access to?
-What sort of computer interactions are we gonna be testing?




TODO:
-Brush up on Python
-Learn about ROS

Demo day:
-Where are we at
-Features that are interesting (Slide 4)
