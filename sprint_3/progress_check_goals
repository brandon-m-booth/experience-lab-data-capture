Goal: Implement ROS2 Functionality and Capture Inputs on One Machine

Specific: Integrate ROS2 functionality into the project and ensure that camera input and keystroke input are captured and recorded successfully on one machine.
Measurable: Verify that the ROS2 integration is functional, and data capture for both camera and keystrokes is working without issues on the designated machine.
Achievable: Leverage available ROS2 libraries and tools, as well as camera and input capture libraries, to achieve this goal.
Relevant: Enhance the project's compatibility and capabilities by integrating ROS2 and demonstrating data capture functionality.
Time-Based: Complete this implementation within Sprint 3, the current sprint.

Goal: Implement Keyboard Visualizer during Playback

Specific: Develop and integrate a keyboard visualizer that works during playback from the rosbag.
Measurable: Ensure the keyboard visualizer accurately reflects keyboard input during playback.
Achievable: Leverage appropriate visualization tools and APIs.
Relevant: Enhance the project's functionality and user experience.
Time-Based: Complete the implementation within sprint 3

Goal: Ensure Workspace Setup and Functionality

Specific: Complete the setup of workspaces to record both keyboard and camera input to a bag simultaneously, ensuring synchronization.
Measurable: Verify successful recording and playback of synchronized data.
Achievable: Leverage available resources and expertise to set up workspaces effectively.
Relevant: This aligns with the client's expectation of functional data capture.
Time-Based: Complete this by then end of Sprint 4.
Goal: Implement Screen and Audio Capture

Specific: Develop and integrate screen and audio capture functionalities into the project.
Measurable: Verify the successful capture of screen and audio data.
Achievable: Utilize appropriate libraries and tools for screen and audio capture.
Relevant: This expands the project's capabilities and meets client expectations.
Time-Based: Ensure this is completed by the end of Sprint 4.

Goal: Design User-Friendly GUI for Node Activation and Bag Recording

Specific: Create a user-friendly graphical interface to control nodes and record bags.
Measurable: Test the GUI's usability and efficiency in controlling the project.
Achievable: Utilize GUI development frameworks and best practices.
Relevant: Enhance user experience and meet client expectations.
Time-Based: Have a prototype of the GUI ready for client review by then end of sprint 4.
