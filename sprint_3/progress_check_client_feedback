progress_check_client_feedback: 

We met with our client on Tuesday Oct 24, at 5:15pm, we told our client about the hardships we are having using ROS 2 with different OS systems. 
Our client wants us to focus on getting things running for one system. 
Our client emphasized that if some of our nodes only work for a certain system (Linux) but not the other (Mac) then it is not the end of the world.
What is important is that we have a working product that we know works for at least one system, and trying to get it to work for both may be another sprint or another semester. 
We should also focus on building GUIs for what we have, so that we can go into sprint 4 with the goal of putting it all together.
