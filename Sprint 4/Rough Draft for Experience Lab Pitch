Welcome to the Experience Lab! Collaborating with our sponsor, Dr. Brandon Booth, we've developed an innovative program capable of capturing data from various sources such as screen recordings, keystrokes, eye tracking, and more. This data is organized into a comprehensive timeline, facilitating research by enabling easy access to specific points in time.

At the Experience Lab, we possess powerful capabilities to utilize this collected data in applications like Machine Learning. Our primary objective is to consolidate all necessary research tools into a single, user-friendly platform. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or completely new to computers, rest assured that Experience Lab strives to simplify your life, catering even to the most computer-unfamiliar individuals.
