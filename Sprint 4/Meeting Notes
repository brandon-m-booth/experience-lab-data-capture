This was our final meeting with Dr. Booth, he was happy with the progress that we made on the Experience Lab. Even though we faced alot of challenges and hardships along the way, we were able to create a foundation that the next people who work on the project can start from. Throughout the semester we informed him of how niche ros2 already was and that the way were are trying to use it is in an even smaller niche, but it is still possible to achieve the other nodes. We will be leaving documentation and this project to spring 24... Good Luck
